## ðŸ“‹ Prompt Template

```
I've just completed a [REFACTOR_TYPE] in my [TECHNOLOGY_STACK] [PROJECT_TYPE] project. Please help me run comprehensive sanity checks to ensure nothing is broken.

**Project Context:**
- Technology Stack: [Python/JavaScript/Java/Go/Rust/etc.]
- Project Type: [CLI tool/Web API/Library/Desktop app/Mobile app/etc.]
- Main functionality: [Brief description of what your project does]
- Architecture: [Monolith/Microservices/Serverless/etc.]
- Recent changes: [Specific description of what was refactored]
- Critical workflows: [List 2-3 most important user journeys]

**Please help me systematically validate:**

1. **Quick Validation (5-10 min)**
   - Run appropriate linting and type checking for my tech stack
   - Test basic functionality and entry points
   - Verify help messages, API endpoints, or core interfaces

2. **Comprehensive Testing (15-30 min)**
   - Run existing test suite (unit + integration)
   - Identify any test failures or coverage gaps
   - Test end-to-end user workflows
   - Validate critical business logic

3. **Integration Points (10-15 min)**
   - Verify component connections work correctly
   - Test parameter passing between functions/modules
   - Validate external dependencies (database, APIs, file system)
   - Check configuration loading and environment variables
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. **Design Pattern Validation (5-10 min, if applicable)**
   - Validate proper implementation of design patterns in use
   - Check Factory patterns return interfaces, not concrete classes
   - Verify Builder patterns support method chaining and validation
   - Test Decorator patterns maintain interface compliance and delegation
   - Validate Observer patterns properly notify all observers
   - Check Strategy patterns are truly interchangeable at runtime
   - Ensure Repository patterns abstract data access properly

5. **Performance & Regression Prevention**
   - Check for performance regressions in critical paths
   - Test known problem areas from past issues
   - Verify backward compatibility (if applicable)
   - Validate security measures are intact

5. **Final Assessment Generation (REQUIRED)**
   - Generate structured validation report
   - Provide clear go/no-go recommendation
   - Include risk assessment and next steps
   - Document validation results for future reference

**Focus Areas Based on Refactor Type:**

[Choose relevant sections:]

**For API/Interface Changes:**
- Endpoint functionality and response formats
- Authentication/authorization
- Request validation and error handling
- API documentation accuracy

**For Database/Storage Changes:**
- Data integrity and migration success
- Query performance
- Connection handling
- Backup/restore procedures

**For Business Logic Changes:**
- Algorithm correctness and edge cases
- State management and transitions
- Validation rules and calculations
- Workflow completeness

**For Infrastructure/Deployment Changes:**
- Build and deployment processes
- Environment configuration
- Service dependencies
- Monitoring and logging

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests pass (unit + integration + functional)
- No linting/type errors
- Critical workflows work end-to-end
- No performance regressions
- External integrations functional
- Security measures intact
- Documentation accurate

**Technology-Specific Needs:**
[Add your specific requirements, e.g.:]
- Database migrations successful
- Docker containers build and run
- Kubernetes deployments work
- CI/CD pipeline passes
- Security scans clean

Please provide specific commands to run for my tech stack and help me identify any issues that need fixing. Focus especially on integration points where components connect, as these are where refactor bugs commonly hide.

**IMPORTANT: Always conclude with a structured final assessment report including:**
- Validation results summary
- Production readiness evaluation
- Clear go/no-go recommendation
- Risk assessment and next steps
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Principles for Any Technology

1. **Integration Over Isolation**: Focus on how components work together
2. **User Journey Validation**: Test complete workflows, not just individual functions
3. **External Dependency Verification**: Database, APIs, file systems, etc.
4. **Performance Baseline Maintenance**: Ensure no significant regressions
5. **Error Handling Validation**: Test failure modes and edge cases
6. **Configuration Flexibility**: Test with different environment settings
7. **Security Posture Maintenance**: Ensure security measures remain intact
