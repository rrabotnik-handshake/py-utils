# 🤖 AI Agent Navigation Guide

**For AI Assistants Using the Universal Refactor Validation Toolkit**

This guide helps AI agents effectively navigate and use the refactor validation toolkit to provide systematic validation guidance to users.

## 🎯 **Quick Agent Decision Tree**

### **Step 1: Understand User's Situation**

Ask yourself:

- **Time available?** (30 sec - 45+ min)
- **Change complexity?** (small fix - major refactor - production deployment)
- **Technology stack?** (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, etc.)
- **Specific concerns?** (performance, patterns, integration, etc.)

### **Step 2: Choose Primary Resource**

```
IF time < 5 minutes:
    → Use REFACTOR_VALIDATION_CHEATSHEET.md
    → Provide quick commands from technology table

ELSE IF user needs AI guidance:
    → Use PROMPT_LIBRARY_INDEX.md to select appropriate prompt
    → Customize prompt with user's specific context

ELSE IF major refactor or production deployment:
    → Use UNIVERSAL_REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md
    → Follow systematic 6-layer validation approach

ELSE IF design patterns involved:
    → Use DESIGN_PATTERN_VALIDATION.md
    → Run validate_patterns.py tool if applicable
```

### **Step 3: Always Include Final Assessment**

- Generate structured validation report (see templates below)
- Provide clear go/no-go recommendation
- Include next steps and risk assessment

## 🚨 **Agent Guidelines & Best Practices**

### **Always Do**
1. **Start with user context** - understand their situation before recommending approach
2. **Provide specific commands** - don't just reference files, give exact commands
3. **Explain the why** - help users understand the validation approach
4. **Generate final assessment** - always provide structured evaluation
5. **Include next steps** - give clear guidance on what to do with results
6. **Adapt to time constraints** - respect user's available time

### **Never Do**
1. **Skip final assessment** - always provide structured evaluation
2. **Give generic advice** - customize for their specific technology and situation
3. **Overwhelm with options** - choose the most appropriate approach
4. **Ignore user constraints** - respect time, technology, and complexity limits
5. **Assume knowledge** - explain tools and approaches clearly

### **Decision Making**
```

IF user says "quick check":
→ Use cheat sheet + mini assessment

IF user says "comprehensive validation":
→ Use full checklist + comprehensive assessment

IF user mentions patterns:
→ Include pattern validation + pattern assessment

IF user mentions performance:
→ Include performance testing in validation plan

IF user mentions production:
→ Use comprehensive approach + full assessment

```

### **Customization Guidelines**
1. **Replace [TECHNOLOGY]** with user's specific language/framework
2. **Replace [PATTERN]** with specific patterns they're using
3. **Replace [COMPONENT]** with what they actually changed
4. **Adapt time estimates** based on their project size
5. **Include relevant tools** they have available
